# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
Thorugh this project I was able to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. I learned how to set up a Node environment with Express, the necessary project dependencies, and used the Fetch API along with my developer credentials and user input to get dynamic data into my app routes. I was also able to setup a server with GET and POST routes, its client side, and learned how to chain promises together.

## Instructions
This required modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. The original project template is listed on the Udacity Github Page. Downloading this project and unzipping it along with its necessary files will run the project.
