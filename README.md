# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
Thorugh this project I was able to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This required modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. The original project template is listed on the Udacity Github Page.
